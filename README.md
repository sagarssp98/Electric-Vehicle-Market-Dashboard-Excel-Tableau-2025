# Electric-Vehicle-Market-Dashboard-Excel-Tableau-2025
1. Interactive Tableau Dashboard for EV Data Analysis
Youâ€™ve designed a dynamic dashboard that provides insights into electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The dashboard is structured around model year, state, make, and model, allowing users to filter and analyze EV data at different levels.
2. Key Performance Metrics & KPIs Tracked
Your dashboard tracks several key performance indicators (KPIs), which are crucial for understanding EV adoption and efficiency:
- Total number of EVs: Helps assess the overall market size and growth trends.
- Average electric range: Indicates how EV models compare in terms of driving range, influencing consumer adoption.
- Breakdown of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV): Provides insights into preferences for fully electric vs. hybrid models.
- Percentage contribution of BEVs vs. PHEVs: Helps evaluate how different types of EVs impact the market share.

3. CAFV Eligibility Status Visualization
Your dashboard incorporates Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility data using dynamic pie charts to:
- Analyze incentive effectiveness: Determines how government incentives and subsidies are impacting EV adoption.
- Segment vehicles based on CAFV eligibility: Allows users to see which models qualify for clean fuel incentives, helping businesses and policymakers make informed decisions.

4. Adoption Trends, Regional Patterns & Top-performing Models
Your dashboard also highlights adoption trends:
- Regional Patterns: Shows EV penetration in different states, identifying regions with high adoption rates.
- Top-performing Models: Highlights the best-selling or most efficient EV models.
- Trend Analysis: Examines yearly changes in EV adoption to forecast future market growth.

Benefits of Your Dashboard
- Interactive Filtering: Users can customize their view based on model year, state, make, or model.
- Data-driven Decisions: Helps policymakers and businesses understand EV market dynamics.
- Visual Clarity: Graphical representations, including pie charts and KPI indicators, enhance comprehension.

This dashboard provides valuable insights into EV adoption patterns and policy impacts! Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain further? ðŸš—âš¡
